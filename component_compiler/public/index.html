			<h1>Upload a .jsx Component for Compilation</h1>
			<p>
				In order to serve a Component via a Provider API, it needs to be
				compiled and have all the external libraries bundled in (except
				for React and ReactDOM).
			</p>
			<p>
				This helper-application was developed, since it is tedious to do
				this manually, and annoying to write the compilation logic into
				every single Provider API Application.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once you are done developing your .jsx Component, compile the
				file using this tool and only serve the compiled version. Make
				sure that all of the needed libraries are installed in the
				parent directory of this application before running it.
